\section{Abstract}\label{sec:abstract}
This report provides an overview of mathematical lattices and 
lattice-based cryptography and provides an in-depth exploration
into and implementation of one particular cryptosystem, the 
Learning With Errors (LWE) cryptosystem. 

A lattice is a structured, periodic set of points in $n$-dimensional
space. It is generated as the set of all integer-coefficient linear
combinations of a set of $n$-length basis vectors. Lattices are promising
cryptographic structures because they form the basis for several problems
that are conjectured to be unsolvable in polynomial time for both 
classical and quantum algorithms. One such problem is the shortest
vector problem (SVP), which entails finding the shortest vector in
a lattice to within a certain approximation factor. Another (at first seemingly unrelated to lattices) problem conjectured to be hard if the learning with errors problem, which entails determining whether a vector has been
sampled from a uniform distribution or a rounded normal distribution. Worst-case SVP can be reduced to LWE. We also give an overview and an implementation
of a public-key cryptosystem that is secure in that successfully attacking
it implies having found a solution to the LWE problem.
